Short quotation <q>To err is human</q> - Alexander Pope
<p><hr>Albert Einstein once said:<blockquote> "Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile."<br>
  The rise of the Genuinfluencers is changing cause marketing—for the better. During the pandemic, social media influencers shifted gears to focus more on highlighting imperfections in brands.
  Too many brands were using a cause to attract consumers but weren’t living up to their promise. When their duplicity was uncovered, it caused severe brand image damage that may last for years.

  Advice for CMOs: Talk the talk, then walk the walk. Stop thinking of cause marketing as a corporate differentiator and truly embrace your cause.</blockquote>

<pre class="my_pre">   Staying up all night to achieve something is a good idea.
Not doing what is meant to be done to achieve the goal will only
             result to stress and waste of time.    What needs to be done to achieve what needs to be achieved is what is done
      during the hours of staying up.......

    <h1>DUMBBELLS: ORIGIN, TYPES AND HISTORY</h1>
</header>
<article>
        <p>The Dumbbell, also known as hand weights and free weights, is undeniably one of the most common equipment utilized for weight training.
        It is usually used in pairs but can also be used individually. <mark>It consists of a narrow single bar in the middle with equal weights on each end.</mark>
        Some dumbbells are very light in weight while others are very heavy.
        With this, dumbbells vary from only a few pounds to as heavy as 50 pounds or more. In addition to that, they can be fixed in weight or variable.
        Weight discs can be added or removed from the bar by quantity or by size. Most people think that this type of equipment has only been in the modern ages. However, this versatile piece of free weight tool has been used for a variety of exercises since 2,000 years ago.
        </p>
    <article>
        <section>
            As stated above, the dumbbell has been used for weight training in order to tone and increase the muscle size.
            They are frequently used by bodybuilders, powerlifters, athletes, and other exercise enthusiasts within their workout routines.
            Each exercise designed using the dumbbell targets a specific group of muscles. With comprehensive and regular exercise, muscles of the arms, shoulders, back, chest, legs, and core can be developed in order to be more toned and strong.

            <li>ADJUSTABLE DUMBBELLS</li>
        </ol>
                <img src="TagsFiles/adjustable.png" alt="adjustable dumbbell">
                <p>This type of dumbbells are the most common type of dumbbells. Exercise beginners or novice can utilize this dumbbell in order to get the hang of weight training.
                    Most home gyms have adjustable dumbbells because they are the most basic ones. <em>It consists of a bar of metal that bears a crosshatch pattern in the center in order to improve the hand grip of the user and reduce the risk of slipping.</em>

            <h3>BENEFITS OF ADJUSTABLE DUMBBELLS</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Just like other dumbbells, you can utilize them to exercise almost all muscle groups of the shoulders, arms, back, chest, and core.
                        They are extremely versatile offering you a wide range of exercises to choose from.</li>

                    <li>They are usually small and significantly safe because of the collars they come with.
                        You can mix plates differently in order to add variety to your exercise through adjusting the collars and adding or subtracting weight plates.</li>
                </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>FIXED-WEIGHT DUMBBELLS</li>
        </ol>
            <img src="TagsFiles/fixed-weight.png" alt="fixed-weight dumbbell">
            <p>Fixed-weight dumbbells are basically weights designed in a dumbbell shape. They are most likely the first ones you see in the gym when you attempt your weight training. Each dumbbell has specific and fixed-weight designed for each exercise.
                Inexpensive variety of this type of dumbbell consists of cast iron often coated with rubber or neoprene in order to add a sense of comfort to users.</p>
            <h3>BENEFITS OF FIXED-WEIGHT DUMBBELLS</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>It challenges your creativity when doing exercises because of its non-adjustable nature.
                        Squats and lunges can be modified together with triceps extensions and lateral raises. It still offers a wide range of exercises to choose from even if it has a fixed weight.</li>
                    <li>Having an entire set requires a lot of space, however if you only buy the ones you think you really need and can aid in your workout program then storing it is easier because you do not have to think with the weight plates like in the adjustable type.
                        More than that, cheaper versions made from plastic will not rust due to the humid environment.</li>
                    <li>You can do weight training faster because changing weights is relatively easier because you do not have to adjust clips or collars
                        to subtract or add weights to do your next exercise.</li>
